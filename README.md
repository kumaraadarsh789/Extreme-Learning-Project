# Extreme-Learning-Project
Project Scope: Clearly states that it covers Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for regression and multiclass classification.  Algorithms: Mentions ELMâ€™s fast, non-iterative training and comparisons with SVM, Random Forest, and MLP.  Datasets: Includes benchmarks like MNIST, Boston Housing, and Iris (as in your README).
Extreme Learning for Regression and Multiclass Classification
Overview
This project explores the implementation and application of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm for regression and multiclass classification tasks. ELM is a fast and efficient technique for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks, offering rapid training and decent generalization performance without iterative backpropagation. The project includes mathematical modeling, experimental results, comparisons with traditional methods, and practical applications in domains such as image recognition, biomedical signal analysis, and financial forecasting.

Features
ELM implementation for:

Regression (predicting continuous values, e.g., house/stock prices)

Multiclass classification (e.g., handwritten digit/image recognition)

Comparative analysis with SVM, Random Forest, and MLP

Supports datasets like MNIST, Boston Housing, Iris

Visualizations: accuracy charts, activation patterns, confusion matrices

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, RMSE, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Technologies Used
Python (suggested)

Libraries: NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
Install required packages:

bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Run the main script to train and evaluate ELM on provided datasets.

Adjust scripts/configurations for different datasets or task types.

Visualizations and reports will be generated in the output directory.
